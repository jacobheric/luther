# Listen to Luther

Spotify's AI DJ X is nice enough...if you want an entirely passive listening
experience. If you want an interactive experience, Listen to Luther instead.

Set the following environment variables in `.env`:

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-spotify-app-client-id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-spotify-app-client-secret

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

Run the server:

```
deno task start
```
